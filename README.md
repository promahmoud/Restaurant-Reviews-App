﻿# (FEND) Project 5: Restaurant Reviews App


# Project Overview

For the  **Restaurant Reviews**  projects, I was tasked to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In  **Stage One**,  I had to take a static design that lacked accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I was also tasked to begin converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.

## Specification

I was provided code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t include any of the standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. I had to update this code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.
